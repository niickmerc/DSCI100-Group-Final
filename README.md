# Predicting Song Popularity Using Regression + Spotify Data 

Music plays a huge role in our experience of the world around us. Daily tasks like walking through campus, working on homework assignments, or simply cooking dinner after a long day, are a lot more enjoyable while listening to your favourite playlist.

For our group project this semester, we decided to work with a dataset called Spotify Tracks DB. This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com and was parsed using Spotify's official API. The dataset has over 110,000 unique observations (tracks) and features 18 relevant variables, each describing a specific qualitative or quantitative characteristic of a track.

For our predictive question, we are asking if specific quantitative characteristics of a track (danceability, energy, tempo) can help predict a new song's popularity on the music streaming service, Spotify.
